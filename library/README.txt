Contained within this library are the files for the Python Puzzles RI Masterclass that need to be installed on the student Pis. 
The files are as follows:

* Client.py - This library is used during session 2 and allows the students to connect to the server and send & receive data.
* Lists.py  - This library is used during session 0 and allows the students to generate a list for their sort algorithm. It also includes a swap function that can be used in the event that the students run out of time.
